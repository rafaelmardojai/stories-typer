# ADVICES
THIS IS PROOF OF CONCEPT SOFTWARE FAR FROM USABLE.

PLEASE DON'T OPEN ISSUES FOR THINGS WE ALL KNOW ARE BROKEN.

CURRENT CODE IS SHITTY AND DIRTY.

Developed by **Rafael Mardojai CM**.

I have used/modified code from [Apostrophe](https://gitlab.gnome.org/somas/apostrophe) and [Zim](https://github.com/zim-desktop-wiki/zim-desktop-wiki) to learn about Gtk/Python text creation apps.
